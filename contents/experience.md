Research Assistant | Advisor: Professor Zhijian He (School of Mathematics, South China University of Technology)

-Proposed the improved generalized Knockoff method based on data splitting.

-Theoretically proved that it can accurately control the false discovery rate (FDR) in finite samples.

-Conducted simulation studies to investigate DS - GKnockoff power improvement by repeated data splitting and full dataset methods.

-Explored the FDR control and power of various Knockoff variant methods.
